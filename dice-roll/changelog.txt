- Created Dice-Roll resource and established standard folder structure (client/server/configuration).
- Added core /roll command with support for dice notation (e.g. d20, 2d6+3), numeric ranges (e.g. 1-500 / 100), and coin flips (coin/flip).
- Implemented configurable limits and defaults via configuration/config.lua (max dice, max sides, max range, default dice/sides).
- Added RP-friendly output using /me formatting with optional prefix/suffix support.
- Added user feedback messages and /rollhelp examples for quick in-game guidance.
- Included server-side version checking integration (Pigeon Studios style) for update notifications.
- Added a README.md for better support about the resource.
